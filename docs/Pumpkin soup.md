- *2 cups* sweet potato (peeled and chopped)
- *2* pumpkin puree (15-oz cans)

- *2 tsp* honey

## Steps

### Soup

1. Add onion, sweet potato, pumpkin puree, tomato sauce, honey (optional, omit
for whole30), chicken stock, granulated garlic powder, cinnamon, and kosher salt
to 6-quart instant pot.

2. Secure the lid, select the manual setting, and set it to high pressure for
8 minutes.

3. When the pressure cooker timer is done, quick release the pressure.

4. Add coconut milk. Using an immersion blender, blend until well combined and
very smooth. If you don’t have an immersion blender, carefully ladle the cooked
tomato mixture into a blender, working in batches. Make sure the lid is on
tightly, cover with a towel, and blend until well combined and very smooth.

5. Taste and add additional kosher salt if desired.
