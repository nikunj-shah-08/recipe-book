## Steps

### Dough

1. In a large bowl combine all-purpose flour, ground nutmeg, sugar and salt
together.

2. Add whole milk, egg, unsalted butter and dried yeast.

3. Combine the dry ingredients and the wet ingredients. Knead the dough on a
work surface for 10 minutes. If you choose to use a stand mixer, knead the dough
on high for 3 minutes.

4. Transfer the dough to a greased bowl, cover and allow the dough to rise for
2 hours.

5. Roll out the dough to about 1 inch thickness and cut out the donut shapes.
Place the donuts onto some parchment paper, brush them with melted unsalted
butter and let them rise again for another 45 minutes.

6. After 45 minutes, preheat your air fryer to 180 °C (350 °F).

7. Once the air fryer has preheated, gently place the donuts into the greased
basket and cook for exactly 3 minutes.

### Glaze

1. Mix together unsalted butter, whole milk, powdered sugar and vanilla extract
for the glaze.

2. Toss the donuts in the glaze and enjoy!
