## Steps

### Dough

1. In a small microwave-safe bowl, warm milk by microwaving it for 45 seconds
to 1 minute, until it registers 115°F on a thermometer and feels like warm bath
water.

2. Place the warmed milk in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle
attachment and sprinkle yeast or active dry) on top. If using active dry yeast,
add sugar now and let the yeast sit with the sugar until foamy, about 5 minutes.
If you haven’t already, add sugar, then butter, egg, and egg yolk. Mix on medium
speed until well combined, 30 seconds. Alternatively, mix with a wooden spoon
until well combined.

3. Remove the bowl from the mixer and use a wooden spoon to stir in bread flour
and kosher salt until a dough begins to form.

4. Place the dough hook on the stand mixer and return the bowl to the mixer. Mix
the dough on medium speed until it comes together and feels soft and slightly
sticky, 8 to 10 minutes. If it’s too sticky—meaning it’s sticking to the bottom
of the mixer—add another bread flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. Alternatively,
you can use your hands to knead the dough for 8 to 10 minutes on a well-floured
surface.

5. Lightly grease a large bowl with extra-virgin olive oil. Transfer the dough
ball to the bowl, then cover with plastic wrap and a warm dish towel. Allow the
dough to rise until doubled in size, 1 to 1½ hours. You will know the dough has
risen enough when you poke your finger into the dough about an inch without the
indentation bouncing back immediately.

6. Generously dust a surface with bread flour. Turn out the dough and use a
rolling pin to roll the dough into an 10 × 14-inch rectangle.

### Filling

1. Spread butter over the dough, leaving a ¼-inch margin at the far short side
of the rectangle. In a small bowl, mix together brown sugar and ground cinnamon.
Use your hands to sprinkle the mixture over the butter, then gently rub the
brown sugar mixture into the butter.

2. Starting from the short side without the margin, very tightly roll up the
dough. Seal the far edge of the dough as best you can by pinching the dough
together just slightly, then make sure the dough log is seam-side down. Cut a
½ inch off the ends of the dough, as the ends won’t have enough filling; feel
free to discard (or bake separately as yummy extras). Use your hands to give the
dough log a gentle push inwards on both ends so that it compacts slightly, as it
may have stretched out a bit during the rolling process.

3. Using unflavored dental floss or a serrated knife, cut the dough into nine 1-
inch slices.

4. Line a round or square 9-inch pan with parchment paper. Place the rolls in
the prepared baking pan. Cover with plastic wrap and a towel and let rise again
until the rolls have puffed up, are doubled in size, and touching each other in
the pan, 45 minutes to 1%hour.

5. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350°F.

### Bake the cinnamon rolls

1. Once the rolls have risen, remove the plastic wrap and towel and bake until
golden brown on the edges, 20 to 25 minutes. Not overbaking the rolls ensures
that they will stay soft in the middle. Cool for 10 minutes.

### Cream Cheese Frosting

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, combine cream
cheese, powdered sugar, butter, and vanilla extract. Beat on low speed for 30
seconds, then increase to medium-high speed until smooth and fluffy, 1 to 2
minutes. Alternatively, whisk the frosting by hand. Spread the frosting over the
warm rolls and serve.

### To store

1. Cover the whole pan with plastic wrap and foil or place individual cinnamon
rolls in airtight containers or silicone bags and store in the fridge for up to
5 days. Reheat the cinnamon rolls individually in the microwave in 15 seconds
intervals until warm.
