## Steps

### Sauce

1. Measure the dry ingredients (flour, ground chili powder, ground cumin, garlic
powder, dried oregano, salt, and ?cinnamon) into a small bowl and place it near
the stove. Place tomato paste and vegetable broth near the stove as well.

2. In a pot over medium heat, warm olive oil until it’s hot enough that a light
sprinkle of the flour/spice mixture sizzles on contact. This might take a couple
of minutes, so be patient and don’t step away from the stove!

3. Once it’s ready, pour in the flour and spice mixture. While whisking
constantly, cook until fragrant and slightly deepened in color, about 1 minute.
Whisk the tomato paste into the mixture, then slowly pour in the vegetable broth
while whisking constantly to remove any lumps.

4. Raise heat to medium-high and bring the mixture to a simmer, then reduce
heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer. Cook, whisking often, for about
5-7 minutes, until the sauce has thickened a bit and a spoon encounters some
resistance as you stir it. (The sauce will thicken some more as it cools.)

5. Remove from heat, then whisk in apple cider vinegar or distilled white
vinegar and season to taste with a generous amount of ground black pepper. Add
more salt (I usually add another pinch or two). Go forth and make enchiladas!
