## Steps

### Batter

1. Combine together all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, baking
soda and salt in a large-sized bowl. Make a well in the centre and add milk,
butter, pure vanilla extract and large egg.

2. Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly
folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may
be a couple of lumps but that's okay). The batter will be thick and creamy in
consistency. If you find the batter too thick - doesn't pour off the ladle or
out of the measuring cup smoothly - fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into
the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency.

3. Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle.

4. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a
little butter to lightly grease the pan. Pour batter onto the pan and spread out
gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.

5. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip
with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.

6. Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yogurt, or enjoy
plain!
