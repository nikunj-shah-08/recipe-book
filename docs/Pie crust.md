- *120 ml* water
- all-purpose flour

## Cookware

## Steps

### Dough

1. Whisk all-purpose flour and salt together in a large bowl.

2. Add unsalted butter and vegetable shortening. Using a pastry cutter or two
forks, cut the butter and shortening into the mixture until it resembles coarse
meal (pea-sized bits with a few larger bits of fat is OK). In this step, you’re
only breaking up the cold fat into tiny little flour-coated pieces; you’re not
completely incorporating it. Do not overwork the ingredients.

3. Measure water in a cup. Add ice. Stir it around. From that, measure water
since the ice has melted a bit. Drizzle the cold water in, water at a time,
and stir with a rubber spatula or wooden spoon after every Tablespoon has been
added. Stop adding water when the dough begins to form large clumps. I always
use about water, and need a little more in dry winter months. Do not add any
more water than you need.

4. Transfer the pie dough to a floured work surface. Using floured hands, fold
the dough into itself until the flour is fully incorporated into the fats.
The dough should come together easily and should not feel overly sticky. Avoid
overworking the dough. If it feels a bit too dry or crumbly, dip your fingers
in the ice water and then continue bringing the dough together with your hands.
If it feels too sticky, sprinkle on more all-purpose flour and then continue
bringing the dough together with your hands. Form it into a ball. Use a sharp
knife to cut it in half. If it’s helpful, you should have about 1 lb, 8 ounces
dough total (about 680g). Gently flatten each half into 1-inch-thick discs using
your hands.

5. Wrap each tightly in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 120 minutes and
up to 5 days.

6. After the dough has chilled for at least 120 minutes, you can roll it out.
Work with one crust at a time, keeping the other in the refrigerator until
you’re ready to roll it out. Lightly flour the work surface, rolling pin,
and your hands, and sprinkle a little flour on top of the dough. Use gentle-
medium force with your rolling pin on the dough—don’t press down too hard on
the dough; you’re not mad at it! When rolling dough out, start from the center
and work your way out in all directions, turning the dough with your hands as
you go. Between passes of the rolling pin, rotate the pie crust and even flip
it, to make sure it’s not sticking to your work surface. Sprinkle on a little
more flour if it’s sticking; don’t be afraid to use a little more flour. If you
notice the dough becoming a lopsided circle as you’re rolling it out, put down
the rolling pin and use your hands to help mold the dough back into an even
circle. Roll the dough into a very thin 12-inch circle, which is the perfect
size to fit a 9-inch pie dish. Your pie dough will be about 1/8 inch thick,
which is quite thin. Visible specks of butter and fat in the dough are perfectly
normal and expected.

7. Because your dough is so thin, use your rolling pin to help transfer the pie
crust to the pie dish. Carefully roll one end of the circle of dough gently onto
the rolling pin, rolling it back towards you, slowly peeling it off the work
surface as you go. Pick it up, and carefully roll it back out over the top of
the pie dish. It’s helpful to watch how I do it in the video below.

8. Proceed with the pie per your recipe’s instructions. If your dough requires
par-baking, see helpful How to Par-Bake Pie Crust tutorial.
