## Steps

### Dough

1. In a medium bowl, whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together. Set aside.

2. In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat butter and sugar
together on high speed until the mixture is light and creamy, about 3 minutes.
Add egg, vanilla extract, and ?almond extract* and beat on high speed until
combined, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl and beat
again as needed to combine. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and
mix on low speed until combined. The dough should be soft. If it seems too soft
and sticky for rolling, beat in flour.

3. Divide the dough in half. Place each portion on a piece of lightly floured
parchment paper or a lightly floured silicone baking mat. With a lightly floured
rolling pin, roll the dough to about 1/4-inch thickness. Use a bit more flour if
the dough seems too sticky. The rolled-out dough can be any shape, as long as it
is evenly 1/4 inch thick.

4. Lightly dust one of the rolled-out dough portions with flour. (This prevents
sticking.) Place the second rolled-out dough portion, still on the parchment
paper, on top of the first. Cover the dough tightly and refrigerate it for 2
hours and up to 2 days.

### Baking

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F (177°C). Line large baking sheets with parchment
paper or silicone baking mats.

2. Carefully remove the top piece of dough from the refrigerator. If it’s
sticking to the bottom, run your hand under it to help remove it. Using a cookie
cutter, cut the dough into shapes. Gather the scraps, reroll, and continue
cutting until all the dough is used. (Note: It doesn’t seem like a lot of dough,
but you get a lot of cookies from the dough scraps you reroll.) Repeat with the
second piece of dough. Arrange the cookies 3 inches apart on the prepared baking
sheets.

3. Bake for 11–12 minutes or until the edges of the cookies are very lightly
browned and set. If your oven has hot spots, rotate the baking sheets halfway
through bake time. Allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes,
then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before decorating.

### Decorating

1. Decorate the cooled cookies with royal icing, easy cookie icing, or cookie
decorating buttercream. Feel free to tint any of the icings with gel food
coloring. See post above for recommended decorating tools. No need to cover the
decorated cookies as you wait for the icing to set. If it’s helpful, decorate
the cookies directly on a baking sheet so you can place the entire baking sheet
in the refrigerator to help speed up the icing setting.

2. Enjoy cookies right away or wait until the icing sets to serve them. Once the
icing has set, these cookies are great for gifting or shipping. Store plain or
iced cookies covered tightly at room temperature for up to 5 days. For longer
storage, cover and refrigerate for up to 10 days. If decorated with cookie
buttercream, cover and store decorated cookies at room temperature for up to 1
day, or in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.
