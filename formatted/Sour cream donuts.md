# Sour Cream Baked Donuts

## Ingredients

- *0.25 cup* vegetable oil
- *0.5 cup* full fat sour cream
- *1* large egg (room temperature)
- *0.5 teaspoon* vanilla extract
- *0.25 cup* vegetable oil
- *0.5 cup* sugar
- *1 cup* all purpose flour
- *0.5 teaspoon* baking soda
- *0.25 teaspoon* cinnamon powder
- *0.25 teaspoon* salt
- *1-2 tablespoons* ?milk
- *1.25 cups* powdered sugar
- *0.25 cup* milk
- *0.25 teaspoon* vanilla extract

## Cookware

- donut pan
- baking rack

## Steps

### Donuts

1. Preheat the oven to 350F/175C. Lightly grease a donut pan with vegetable oil.

2. In a medium sized bowl combine the wet ingredients: full fat sour cream,
large egg, vanilla extract, and vegetable oil and sugar. Whisk until fully
incorporated.

3. Add in all purpose flour, baking soda, cinnamon powder, and salt. Mix
together until fully incorporated and a thick batter is formed. If you feel the
batter is a bit too thick, then add ?milk. However, the batter should be on the
thick side, and not very thin.

4. Using a tablespoon, spread the batter evenly in each donut cavity.
Alternatively, you can pipe the batter into the donut cavities. I did not fill
the donut cavities all the way up to the top, so I was able to get 8 donuts from
this batter. However, if you want bigger donuts then you can fill the cavities
till about full, but the donut holes will be slightly closed up if you do so.

5. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the donuts are golden brown and springy to
touch. Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 10-15 minutes, and then
remove the donuts from the pan.

### Glaze

1. Combine powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla extract in a medium sized bowl.
After the donuts have come to room temperature, dip each donut into the glaze
and cover completely. Place on a baking rack so that excess glaze can be
dripped.

2. The donuts can be stored up to 3-4 days in the fridge in an airtight
container.
