## Steps

### Dough

1. Whisk instant or active dry yeast and brown sugar into warm water. Cover and
allow to sit for 1 minute.

2. Whisk in unsalted butter and salt. Add all-purpose flour. Mix with a wooden
spoon or dough hook attachment until combined. Add all-purpose flour more until
the dough is slightly tacky and pulls away from the sides of the bowl. If it is
still sticky, add up to all-purpose flour, 1 Tablespoon at a time, as needed.
Poke the dough with your finger—if it bounces back, it is ready to knead.

3. Keep the dough in the mixer and beat for 3 to 5 minutes, or knead by hand on
a lightly floured surface for 3 to 5 minutes. If the dough becomes too sticky
during the kneading process, sprinkle all-purpose flour at a time on the dough
or on the work surface/in the bowl to make a soft, slightly tacky dough. Do
not add more flour than you need because you do not want a dry dough. After
kneading, the dough should still feel a little soft. Poke it with your finger
—if it slowly bounces back, your dough is ready to rise. You can also do a
“windowpane test” to see if your dough has been kneaded long enough: tear off
a small (roughly golfball-size) piece of dough and gently stretch it out until
it’s thin enough for light to pass through it. Hold it up to a window or light.
Does light pass through the stretched dough without the dough tearing first? If
so, your dough has been kneaded long enough and is ready to rise. If not, keep
kneading until it passes the windowpane test.

4. Shape the kneaded dough into a ball. Cover lightly with a towel and allow to
rest for 10 to 30 minutes.

### Pretzel Preparation

1. Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C). Line baking sheet with parchment paper or
silicone baking mats. Silicone baking mats are highly recommended over parchment
paper. If using parchment paper, lightly spray with nonstick spray or grease
with butter. Set aside.

2. With a sharp knife or pizza cutter, cut dough into sections of dough, which
is about 1/3 cup of dough each.

3. Roll the dough into a 20–22-inch rope. Form a circle with the dough by
bringing the 2 ends together at the top of the circle. Twist the ends together.
Bring the twisted ends back down towards yourself and press them down to form a
pretzel shape.

4. Bring baking soda and water to a boil in a pot.

5. Drop 1–2 pretzels into the boiling water for 20 to 30 seconds. Any longer
than that and your pretzels will have a metallic taste. Using a slotted spatula,
lift the pretzel out of the water and allow as much of the excess water to drip
off. Place pretzel onto prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining pretzels.
If desired, cover the boiled, unbaked pretzels with lightly oiled plastic wrap
and refrigerate for up to 24 hours before baking.

6. Sprinkle the tops of the pretzels with coarse salt.

7. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes or until dark golden brown.

8. Remove from the oven and, if desired, serve warm with spicy nacho cheese
sauce.

9. Cover and store leftover pretzels at room temperature for up to 3 days.
