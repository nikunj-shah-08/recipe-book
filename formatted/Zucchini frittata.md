# Caramelized Zucchini Frittata

## Ingredients

- *0.5* onion (peeled and finely chopped)
- *1* zucchini (medium)
- *2 tbsp* butter
- *2 tbsp* olive oil
- *0.25 teaspoon* salt
- *6* eggs (large)
- *0.5 cup* milk
- *0.5 teaspoon* salt
- *2 ounces* cheddar cheese (shredded)
- ground black pepper
- *1 handful* basil (julienned)

## Cookware

- 8" oven-safe skillet

## Steps

### Filling

1. Heat an oven to 425F. Mince onion and finely dice zucchini into 1/4" cubes.

2. Heat an 8" oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add butter or olive oil
followed by the onions, zucchini, and salt. Cook over medium heat for 15-
20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the zucchini and onions are tender,
browned, and cooked down. If you find the mixture starts to scorch, lower the
heat slightly.

### Frittata

1. While the vegetables cook, whisk together eggs, milk, and salt. Once the
vegetables are ready, reduce the heat to low and pour the egg mixture into the
skillet. Swirl the eggs around the pan and use a spatula to loosen any zucchini
or onion stuck to the bottom. Cook for a few minutes until the bottom of the
frittata is set, but the top is still wet.

2. Sprinkle cheddar cheese on top of the frittata and transfer to the oven. Bake
for 18-20 minutes, or until the eggs are fully set and the top of the frittata
is puffed up and golden. Sprinkle with ground black pepper for garnish and basil
before serving.
