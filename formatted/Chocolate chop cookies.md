# Chocolate Chip Cookies Recipe

## Ingredients

- *2½ cups* all-purpose flour (300g)
- *¾ teaspoon* baking soda
- *¾ teaspoon* salt
- *1 cup* unsalted butter (softened)
- *¾ cup* light brown sugar (165g)
- *1* large egg
- *1 tablespoon* vanilla extract
- *1½ cups* semisweet chocolate chips (or chocolate chunks)

## Cookware

- baking sheets
- silicone mat
- stand mixer

## Steps

### Cookies

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper or a
silicone mat.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt.

3. In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment or a large mixing
bowl with a handheld mixer, combine unsalted butter(227g) and light brown sugar.
Beat on medium-low speed until very light and fluffy, about 5 minutes.

4. Add large egg and vanilla extract. Beat until well combined, scraping down
the sides of the bowl.

5. With the mixer on low, gradually add the flour mixture. Beat just until
combined. Stir in semisweet chocolate chips(270g).

6. Using a 1½-tablespoon scoop, scoop the dough into balls and place on the
prepared baking sheets. Press more chocolate chips on top. (If desired, chill
the dough balls for 1 hour, or cover and chill for up to 72 hours.)

7. Bake for 12-14 minutes or until the edges are golden brown. (If you’ve
chilled your cookies, bake for 13-15 minutes.) For best results, bake one sheet
at a time. Immediately sprinkle cookies with flaked salt, if desired.

8. Let the cookies cool on the pan for 5-10 minutes. Finish cooling on a wire
rack. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.
