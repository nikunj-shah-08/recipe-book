# Chocolate Cake Recipe

## Ingredients

- butter
- *2 cups* all-purpose flour
- *2 cups* granulated sugar
- *0.5 cups* unsweetened cocoa powder
- *1.5 tsp* baking powder
- *1.5 tsp* baking soda
- *0.5 tsp* kosher salt
- *1 cup* whole milk
- *2* large eggs
- *0.5 cup* vegetable oil
- *1 tbsp* vanilla extract
- *1 cup* boiling water
- *1 cup* hot coffee
- *1.5 cups* unsalted butter (room temperature)
- *0.25 cups* unsweetened cocoa powder
- *0.25 tsp* salt
- *6 cups* powdered sugar
- *3 to 4 tbsp* whole milk
- *1 tsp* vanilla
- *1 cup* frosting

## Cookware

- 2 9-inch round cake pans

## Steps

### For the Cake

1. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease 2 9-inch round cake pans with butter or
baking spray and line the bottom of each pan with parchment paper. (I highly
recommend using cake strips for a more even bake.)

2. Sift all-purpose flour and granulated sugar and unsweetened cocoa powder and
baking powder and baking soda and kosher salt into a large mixing bowl and whisk
to combine.

3. In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together whole milk and large eggs and
vegetable oil and vanilla extract. Add to the flour mixture and whisk together
until well combined. Pour in boiling water or hot coffee and whisk until well
combined. (The batter will be runny.)

4. Divide the batter between the prepared cake pans.

5. Bake for 35 minutes or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out
clean. Let the cakes cool in the pans on a wire cooling rack for 15 minutes.
Carefully invert the cake layers onto the wire rack, remove the parchment paper,
and let cool completely.

### For the Chocolate Buttercream

1. In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat unsalted
butter on medium speed until soft and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add unsweetened
cocoa powder and salt and mix on low speed until combined. Scrape the bowl down.

2. While mixing on low speed, gradually add in powdered sugar alternating
with whole milk up to 4 tablespoons. Once the sugar is added, beat in vanilla.
Scrape down the bowl and beat on medium-low speed until light and fluffy, about
1 minute.

### For the Assembly

1. Place a cooled cake layer on a cake stand. Top with frosting and spread
it out to the edges in an even layer. Place the remaining cake layer on top
and spread the rest of the frosting all over the outside of the cake. You can
reserve some of the frosting to pipe decorations if desired.
