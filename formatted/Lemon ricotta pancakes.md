# Lemon Ricotta Pancakes Recipe

## Ingredients

- *1½ cups* all-purpose flour (160g)
- *2 tbsp* granulated sugar
- *2 tsp* baking powder
- *½ tsp* baking soda
- *¼ tsp* salt
- *¾ cup* ricotta cheese (180g)
- *⅔ cup* whole milk (160mL)
- *¼ cup* lemon juice (60mL)
- *2* eggs (large)
- *2 tsp* lemon zest
- *1 tsp* vanilla extract
- *3 tbsp* butter (melted and cooled slightly)
- *1 tsp* butter (melted)

## Cookware

- large bowl
- medium bowl
- nonstick skillet
- griddle

## Steps

### Batter

1. In a large bowl, whisk together all-purpose flour, granulated sugar, baking
powder, baking soda, and salt.

2. In a medium bowl, whisk together ricotta cheese, whole milk, lemon juice,
eggs, lemon zest, and vanilla extract.

3. Pour the ricotta mixture into the flour mixture. Fold together to make a
lumpy batter. Pour in butter and stir until combined but still slightly lumpy.

### Cooking Pancakes

1. Heat a large nonstick skillet or griddle over medium-high heat. Once hot,
coat with butter. Working in batches, add batter 1/4 cup for each pancake,
leaving about 2 inches of space between each. (The batter will be thick, but
will spread as it cooks.)

2. Cook for 3 to 4 minutes until golden on the bottom and bubbles start to
appear on the top. Flip over and cook for 1 to 2 minutes or until golden brown.

3. Repeat with the remaining pancake batter, adjusting the heat to medium or
medium low as needed. (The pancakes cook more quickly and brown more easily in
subsequent batches.)
