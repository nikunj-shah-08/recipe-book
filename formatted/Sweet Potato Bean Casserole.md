aside.

2. In a large bowl, combine sweet potato that has been slightly softened, black

them to the sweet potato mixture.

3. Spread salsa on the bottom of the baking dish. Arrange a tortillas on top,
ripping into strips to get the right fit. Spoon a large layer of the sweet
potato/black bean mixture over the tortilla strips. Spread the remaining salsa
over the sweet potato/black bean layer.

black bean mixture over the tortilla layer. Top with shredded cheese.

5. Bake, uncovered, 20-25 minutes until the cheese is melted and the top is
slightly browned. Let stand 5 minutes. Cut into squares and serve. Top with
additional salsa (optional), cilantro, avocado, guacamole, and/or sour cream.
